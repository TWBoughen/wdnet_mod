\title{Degree-based centrality}
\usage{
degree_c(adj, alpha = 1, mode = "out")
}
\arguments{
\item{adj}{is an adjacency matrix of a weighted and directed network}

\item{alpha}{is a tuning parameter. The value of alpha must be nonnegative. By convention, 
alpha takes a value from 0 to 1 (default).}

\item{mode}{which mode to compute: "out" (default) or "in"? For undirected networks, this
setting is irrelevant.}
}
\value{
a list of node names and associated degree centrality measures
}
\description{
Compute the degree centrality measures of the vertices in a weighted and directed
network represented through its adjacency matrix.
}
\note{
Function \code{degree_c} is an extension of function \code{strength} 
in package \code{igraph} and an alternative of function \code{degree_w} in 
package \code{tnet}. Function \code{degree_c} uses adjacency matrix as
input.
