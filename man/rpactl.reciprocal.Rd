\title{Set parameters for controlling reciprocal edges}
\usage{
rpactl.reciprocal(group.prob = NULL, recip.prob = NULL, selfloop.recip = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{group.prob}{A vector of probability weights for sampling the group of
new nodes. Defined for directed networks. Groups are from 1 to
\code{length(group.prob)}. Its length must equal to the number of rows of
\code{recip.prob}.}

\item{recip.prob}{A square matrix giving the probability of adding a
reciprocal edge after a new edge is introduced. Defined for directed
networks. Its element \code{p_{ij}} represents the probability of adding a
reciprocal edge from node \code{A}, which belongs to group \code{i}, to
node \code{B}, which belongs to group \code{j}, immediately after a
directed edge from \code{B} to \code{A} is added.}

\item{selfloop.recip}{Logical, whether reciprocal edge of self-loops are
allowed.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{rpactl} with components 
  \code{group.prob}, \code{recip.prob}, and \code{selfloop.recip} with
  meanings as explained under 'Arguments'.

\examples{
control <- rpactl.reciprocal(group.prob = c(0.4, 0.6),
    recip.prob = matrix(runif(4), ncol = 2))
