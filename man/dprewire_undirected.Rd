\title{Degree preserving rewiring for undirected networks}
\usage{
dprewire_undirected(
  edgelist,
  eta,
  iteration = 1,
  nattempts = NULL,
  rewire.history = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{edgelist}{A two column matrix, each row represents an undirected edge.}

\item{eta}{An matrix, target structure \code{eta} generated by
\code{wdnet::get_eta_undirected()}.}

\item{iteration}{An integer, number of rewiring iterations, each iteration
consists of \code{nattempts} rewiring attempts.}

\item{nattempts}{An integer, number of rewiring attempts for each iteration.
Default value equals the number of rows of edgelist.}

\item{rewire.history}{Logical, whether the rewiring history should be
returned.}
}
\value{
Rewired edgelist, assortativity coefficient after each iteration, and
  rewiring history (including the index of sampled edges and rewiring
  result). For each rewiring attempt, two rows are sampled from the edgelist,
  for example Edge1:\{v_1, v_2\} and Edge2:\{v_3, v_4\}, the function try to 
  rewire the sampled edges as \{v_1, v_4\}, \{v_3, v_2\} (rewire type 1) 
  or \{v_1, v_3\}, \{v_2, v_4\} (rewire type 2) with probability 1/2.

Degree preserving rewiring towards the target structure \code{eta}.
