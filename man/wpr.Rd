\title{Weighted PageRank centrality}
\usage{
wpr(adj, gamma = 0.85, theta = 1, prior.info)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj}{is an adjacency matrix of a weighted and directed network}

\item{gamma}{is the damping factor; it takes 0.85 (default) if not given.}

\item{theta}{is a tuning parameter leveraging node degree and strength; theta = 0 does not consider
edge weight; theta = 1 (default) fully considers edge weight.}

\item{prior.info}{vertex-specific prior information for restarting when arriving at a sink. When
it is not given (\code{NULL}), a random restart is implemented.}
}
\value{
a list of node names with corresponding weighted PageRank scores
}
\description{
Compute the weighted PageRank centrality measures of the vertices in a weighted and directed 
network represented through its adjacency matrix.
}
\note{
Function \code{wpr} is an extension of function \code{page_rank} 
in package \code{igraph}.
